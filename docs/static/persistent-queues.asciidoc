=== Persistent Queues

WARNING: This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. It should be deployed in production at your own risk.

By default, Logstash uses in-memory bounded queues between pipeline stages
(input → filter and filter → output) to buffer events. The size of these 
in-memory queues is fixed and not configurable. If Logstash terminates unsafely,
either as the result of a software failure or the user forcing an unsafe
shutdown, it's possible to lose queued events. 

To prevent event loss in these scenarios, you can configure Logstash to use
persisent queues. With persistent queues enabled, Logstash persists buffered
events to disk instead of storing them in memory. 

Persistent queues are also useful for Logstash deployments that require high
throughput and resiliency. Instead of deploying and managing a message
broker, such as Redis, RabbitMQ, or Apache Kafka, to handle a mismatch in
cadence between the shipping stage and the relatively expensive processing
stage, you can enable persistent queues to buffer events on disk. The queue size
is variable and configurable, which means that you have more control over
managing situations that could result in back pressure to the source. 

[[persistent-queues-advantages]]
==== Advantages of Persistent Queues

Using persistent queues:

* Provides protection from losing in-flight messages when the Logstash process is shut down or the machine is restarted.
* Handles the surge of events without having to use an external queueing mechanism like Redis or Kafka.
* Provides an at-least-once message delivery guarantee. If Logstash is restarted
while events are in-flight, Logstash will attempt to deliver messages stored
in the persistent queue until delivery succeeds at least once. In other words,
messages stored in the persistent queue may be duplicated, but not lost.

[[persistent-queues-limitations]]
==== Limitations of Persistent Queues

The current implementation of persistent queues has the following limitations:

* This version does not enable full end-to-end resiliency. Logstash only
acknowledges delivery of messages in the filter and output stages, and not all
the way back to the input or source.
* It does not handle permanent disk or machine failures. The data persisted to disk is not replicated, so it is still a single point of failure.

[[persistent-queues-architecture]]
==== How Persistent Queues Work

The persistent queue sits between the input and filter stages in the same
process:

input → persistent queue → filter + output 

The input stage reads data from the configured data source and writes events to
the persistent queue for processing. As events pass through the pipeline,
Logstash pulls a batch of events from the persistent queue for processing them
in the filter and output stages. As events are processed, Logstash uses a
checkpoint file to track which events are successfully acknowledged (ACKed) as
processed by Logstash. An event is recorded as ACKed in the checkpoint file if
the event is successfully sent to the last output stage in the pipeline;
Logstash does not wait for the output to acknowledge delivery. 

During a normal, controlled shutdown (*CTRL+C*), Logstash finishes
processing the current in-flight events (that is, the events being processed by
the filter and output stages, not the queued events), finalizes the ACKing
of these events, and then terminates the Logstash process. Upon restart,
Logstash uses the checkpoint file to pick up where it left off in the persistent
queue and processes the events in the backlog. 

If Logstash crashes or experiences an uncontrolled shutdown, any in-flight
events are left as unACKed in the persistent queue. Upon restart, Logstash will
replay the events from its history, potentially leading to duplicate data being
written to the output.

[[configuring-persistent-queues]]
==== Configuring Persistent Queues

To configure persistent queues, you can specify the following options in the
Logstash settings file:

* `queue.type`: Specify `persisted` to enable persistent queues. By default, persistent queues are disabled (`queue.type: memory`).
* `path.queue`: The directory path where the data files will be stored. By default, the files are stored in `path.data/queue`. 
* `queue.page_capacity`: The size of the page data file. The queue data consists of append-only data files separated into pages. The default size is 250mb. 
* `queue.max_events`:  The maximum number of unread events that are allowed in the queue. The default is 0 (unlimited).
* `queue.max_bytes`: The total capacity of the queue in number of bytes. The
default is 1024mb (1g). Make sure the capacity of your disk drive is greater
than the value you specify here. If both `queue.max_events` and 
`queue.max_bytes` are specified, Logstash uses whichever criteria is reached
first. 

You can also specify options that control when the checkpoint file gets updated (`queue.checkpoint.acks`, `queue.checkpoint.writes`, and
`queue.checkpoint.interval`). See <<logstash-settings-file>> for more
information about these options.

Example configuration:

[source, yaml]
queue.type: persisted
queue.max_bytes: 4g 

[[backpressure-persistent-queues]]
==== Handling Back Pressure

Logstash has a built-in mechanism that adds back pressure to the data flow when
the queue is full. This mechanism helps Logstash control the rate of data flow
at the input stage without overwhelming downstream stages and outputs like
Elasticsearch.

You can control when back pressure happens by using the `queue.max_bytes` 
setting to configure the capacity of the queue on disk. The following example
sets the total capacity of the queue to 8gb:

[source, yaml]
queue.type: persisted
queue.max_bytes: 8gb

With these settings specified, Logstash will buffer unACKed events on disk until 
the size of the queue reaches 8gb. When the queue is full of unACKed events, and
the size limit has been reached, Logstash will no longer accept new events. This
process is called back pressure.

Each input handles back pressure independently. For example, when the
<<plugins-inputs-beats,beats>> input encounters back pressure, it no longer
accepts new connections and waits until the persistent queue has space to accept
more events. After the filter and output stages finish processing existing
events in the queue and ACKs them, Logstash automatically starts accepting new
events.
