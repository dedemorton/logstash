=== Centralized Pipeline Management

//REVIEWERS: I'm not sure if centralized pipeline management is the right term to use here, but if we want to have a generic container for lots of types of configuration management, we need to distinguish pipeline management.

NOTE: Centralized pipeline management is an {xpack} feature that requires a
paid {xpack} license. 

//REVIEWERS: I'm not sure we want to mention actual types of licenses, like Gold, if they might change in the future. Is there a resource that I can point to that outlines the feature support? Is there other language that I should use here to call out the fact that a paid license is required?

The pipeline management feature in {xpack} centralizes the creation and
management of Logstash configuration pipelines. From within the pipeline
management UI, you can add, edit, and delete pipeline configurations.

The pipeline configurations are stored in the .`logstash` index in Elasticsearch.
Any changes that you make to a pipeline definition in the UI are picked up and
loaded automatically by all Logstash instances registered to use the pipeline.
The changes are applied immediately; you do not have to restart Logstash to pick
up the changes, as long as Logtash is already registered to use the pipeline.

To use centralized pipeline management, you must install {xpack} and specify
the configuration management settings described in
{logstash-ref}/setup-xpack.html[Setting up {xpack}].

==== Pipeline management UI

To access the pipeline management UI, open {kib} in your browser and go to
the Management tab. If you've set up configuration management correctly, you'll
see an area for managing Logstash. Click the *Pipelines* link.

Here you can add, edit, or delete Logstash pipeline configurations.

To add a new pipeline, click the *Add* button and specify values for the
following fields:

[horizontal]
Pipeline ID::
A name that uniquely identifies the pipeline. You use this ID when you set up
{logstash-ref}pipeline-management-settings[configuration management] and specify
a list of pipeline IDs in the `xpack.management.pipeline.id` setting.

Version::
Metadata for tracking the version of the pipeline configuration. This information
is for your use. Logtash doesn't currently manage or validate the version information.

Description::
A description of the pipeline configuration. This information is for your use.

Pipeline::
The pipeline configuration.

When you click *Save*, the pipeline runs on all Logstash instances that are
registered to use the pipeline. 

You can specify multiple pipeline configurations that run in parallel on the
same Logstash node.

If you edit a pipeline configuration and save the changes, Logstash reloads
the configuration in the background and continues processing events.

If you delete a pipeline, it's deleted permanently.
